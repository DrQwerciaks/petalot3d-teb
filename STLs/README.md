# Print Guide

Material Usage: 425g.

I slice the parts in Cura with 2 perimeters and alternate extra wall, 4 top and bottom layers, seam: "sharpest corner" and "smart hiding", 0.44mm line width, 30% infill and 0.2mm layer height, gyroid infill. Combing mode: not on outer surface.

if you have tolerance problems try changing the "horizontal expansion" (-0.05, -0.1, ...).

All the parts can be printed on a 200mm x 200mm build plate.
